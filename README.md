<h1>Space Adventure 2D</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Space Adventure 2D is an exciting game currently under development, created as part of my Game Design course, where I am specializing in the art of creating interactive and engaging experiences. The main goal of this project is to create a captivating 2D game by combining game design skills and programming to deliver a unique experience to players.

In this project, the game art was provided by the school, providing a stunning and immersive visual experience. My main contribution focused on carefully organizing the environment art, bringing to life a vibrant world full of challenges. Additionally, I took responsibility for implementing robust object collision physics, ensuring smooth and realistic gameplay.

Throughout the development process, we were introduced to a wide range of fundamental game design concepts and practices, exploring various mechanics and essential elements for creating a fun and engaging experience. Through a combination of research, case studies, and analysis of popular games, I was able to incorporate this knowledge into our project, creating an exciting and challenging gameplay.

This project went beyond the content provided in the course. Approximately 60% of the scripts were enhanced and optimized through additional research and exploration outside of class, ensuring the use of best practices and achieving the best possible results. This demonstrates my dedication to constantly seeking excellence and continuous improvement.

Space Adventure 2D aims to showcase my progress as a game developer so far, highlighting the skills and competencies I have acquired throughout the course. It is a testament to my commitment to quality, creativity, and attention to detail, which are essential in creating engaging and memorable games.

<h2>Features</h2>
Player character control: Players can control an astronaut in a 2D environment using arrow keys to move the character left or right.
Player actions: The character can perform jumps by pressing the space bar and shoot lasers by pressing the "S" key.
Running: By holding the Shift key, the player character can run faster to face challenges with agility.
Collectibles: There are various collectible elements, such as coins and life items, scattered throughout the environment. By collecting these items, the player earns points or recovers their health.
Enemies: The game features various types of enemies that the player must defeat to progress. Each enemy has distinct behaviors and attack patterns, requiring different strategies to defeat them.
Particle system: The environment is enriched with particle effects, providing a more immersive and dynamic visual experience.
  
<h2>Game Objective</h2>
After an emergency landing on an unknown planet, the protagonist astronaut must find shelter in a cave located at the end of the path. To reach it, the astronaut must overcome a series of challenges, such as platforms, traps, and hostile enemies. Along the way, the player must collect resources like coins and life items to earn points and replenish their energy. The game is divided into multiple levels with increasing difficulty, gradually testing the player's skills.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
Space Adventure 2D was developed using the following technologies:

Unity Engine 3D: A powerful 3D game development engine used in this project to create the environment, implement game logic, and manage object physics.
C#: A widely used programming language for game development in the Unity Engine. It was used to write scripts that control player behavior, enemies, collectibles, and other game elements.
